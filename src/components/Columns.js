						<h2>The Anatomy of a 5 Minute Picture</h2>
<p>After dinner, I walked around downtown to see some nighttime views, just as the sun was setting. But as I got to the statue of Marcus Whitman, my Mom called me just as I was about to press the button. As I talked to my Mom, I got the chance to appreciate surrounding area, from the tree behind it to the moon. In the end, after talking to Mom, I got the picture I wanted, incorporating all three elements in my picture. Hence, the anatomy of a 5 minute Picture.</p>

							<h2>Hot Poop!</h2>
							<p>A music store located in Walla Walla, Hot Poop obviously stands out for its funny name. I walked inside just to check it out, but the store was cluttered and felt too much like a maze. I saw some Hot Poop shirts, but nothing I really liked. Otherwise, I didn't see anything to my liking. After a couple of minutes of not seeing anything, I walked out. But hey, I did check out Hot Poop. At least it's not cold.</p></Paper>

						<h1>Going Cluckers for Wingman Birdz n Brewz. A restaurant review</h1>
						<p>While I was walking through downtown Walla Walla, I decided to look for some dinner places. I admit I did some research beforehand, coming across a cool looking place called Wingman Birdz & Brewz. There were some other decent places I saw, but nothing stood out as a fun place like this place. So looking for an early dinner, ate my dinner here.</p>

						<p>Inside, I found a fun sports-bar type atmosphere with lots of TVâ€™s with NCAA tournament action and fun looking waiters and waitresses. Though this place looked like a good place to have a beer, I was craving a glass of wine, being in the heart of Walla Walla Wine Country. I settled for a favorite varietal, the Malbec from Oregon. It was quite delicious, a great selection on my behalf.</p>

						<p>For dinner, I picked their standard item, chicken wings. I settled for 6 Boneless Wings with a side of French Fries. For the wings, I had the option of dipping it in a long variety of sauces. I couldn't decide on one I really wanted from a long list, so I picked the Carolina BBQ, with its mustard based BBQ. A questionable pair with the Malbec but I didn't care. The wings were quite delicious, they went down fairly quickly and savored every bite. The fries were plenty and good, seeing that I haven't had them in a while, but they weren't my favorite French Fries by any means.</p>

						<p>Overall, I had a good experience at Wingman Birdz & Brewz. On the plus side, I had a good glass of wine and dinner. On the downside, the only NCAA basketball game I was able to see where I was sitting was Wisconsin vs. Pitt, which was the lowest scoring tournament game in about 15 years. Close game, but I couldn't get into it.</p>

						<h1>Boardman, Oregon</h1>
						<h3>Not a place to visit Twice</h3>
						<p>Boardman, Oregon, enough to make you bored man in Oregon. For some reason, my sister felt it was important to tell my Dad I went there twice, based on my Swarm check-in's. Of course, I only stopped there once on the way back. Heading out there, I made a restroom stop near Boardman. I remember going to the rest stop there once remembering it to be the most disgusting bathroom I had ever been in. This time I was pleasantly surprised; it even had a modern sink. Coming back the other direction, I stopped to stretch and walked around a park along the Columbia River for a few minutes. Peaceful enough to remind me why small towns are enjoyable in the right situation, yet not the type of place I would want to live in. Arlington was more interesting when I walked around there a couple of years back. There are way too many industrial plants outside of Boardman, which reminds me too much of Millersburg, Oregon with all the stinky plants along I-5. All in all, it was worth it to stretch out. I even saw a bunch of birds dive into the Columbia River all at once. That was a worthy event. But it's not worth visiting twice, sorry Jenn.</p>
