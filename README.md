## Technologies used
* React
* Redux
* Material UI

## Version 1

I initially created this project in 2016, using basic JavaScript and jQuery.  It wasn't until later in 2016 that I began building projects with more robust frameworks, with React my primary framework.

## Version 2

I revisited this project in late 2019/early 2020, looking to build this using React, while adding new tools to the build.  That led me to focus on ways to improve the front end UI.  Thus, I experimented with Material UI for the first time.  I've used design systems like Bootstrap and Foundation before, but Material UI provided me the option to create styles in JavaScript, rather than using tools Sass or CSS directly.  It was with this that I got an introduction to React's Hook API, as I used it per Material UI guide to access styles.  I used Redux to contain the state of the styles, along with other data, including Markdown data.
