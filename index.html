          <h2>The Anatomy of a 5 Minute Picture</h2>
          <p>After dinner, I walked around downtown to see some nighttime views, just as the sun was setting.  But as I got to the statue of Marcus Whitman, my Mom called me just as I was about to press the button.  As I talked to my Mom, I got the chance to appreciate surrounding area, from the tree behind it to the moon.  In the end, after talking to Mom, I got the picture I wanted, incorporating all three elements in my picture.  Hence, the anatomy of a 5 minute Picture.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Going Cluckers for Wingman Birdz n Brewz. <span class="text-muted">A restaurant review</span></h2>
          <p>While I was walking through downtown Walla Walla, I decided to look for some dinner places.  I admit I did some research beforehand, coming across a cool looking place called Wingman Birdz & Brewz.  There were some other decent places I saw, but nothing stood out as a fun place like this place.  So looking for an early dinner, ate my dinner here.</p>
          <p>Inside, I found a fun sports-bar type atmosphere with lots of TVâ€™s with NCAA tournament action and fun looking waiters and waitresses.  Though this place looked like a good place to have a beer, I was craving a glass of wine, being in the heart of Walla Walla Wine Country.  I settled for a favorite varietal, the Malbec from Oregon.  It was quite delicious, a great selection on my behalf.</p>
          <p>For dinner, I picked their standard item, chicken wings.  I settled for 6 Boneless Wings with a side of French Fries.  For the wings, I had the option of dipping it in a long variety of sauces.  I couldn't decide on one I really wanted from a long list, so I picked the Carolina BBQ, with its mustard based BBQ.  A questionable pair with the Malbec but I didn't care.  The wings were quite delicious, they went down fairly quickly and savored every bite.  The fries were plenty and good, seeing that I haven't had them in a while, but they weren't my favorite French Fries by any means.</p>
          <p>Overall, I had a good experience at Wingman Birdz & Brewz.  On the plus side, I had a good glass of wine and dinner.  On the downside, the only NCAA basketball game I was able to see where I was sitting was Wisconsin vs. Pitt, which was the lowest scoring tournament game in about 15 years.  Close game, but I couldn't get into it.</p>
